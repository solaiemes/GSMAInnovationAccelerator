joyn Innovation Challenge– the competition has started!

The joyn Innovation Challenge is an initiative to encourage innovation based on joyn (http://www.gsma.com/rcs/joyninnovationchallenge/). The challenge will stimulate mobile and web app developers and technology innovators to build on the core capabilities of joyn (Contact management, Chat and File Share) and explore ideas for new and attractive services.

Developers wanting to explore the RCS APIs can do so using the joyn Innovation Accelerator. The Innovation Accelerator gives developers global access to a live GSMA Rich Communication Services (RCS) network where they can build on RCS APIs and test their new service or application ideas in a trusted and safe environment.

Developers are invited to register their interest to participate the challenge here and submit their final application before 12th December. The best entry will receive the prestigious ‘joyn Innovation Challenge Award’ that recognises the most innovative, compelling and creative idea developed using the joyn platform. The best new ideas will be showcased on the GSMA’s exhibition stand at the Mobile World Congress, 2013.
